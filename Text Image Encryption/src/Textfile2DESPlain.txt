    Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes
This course lays the foundation for graduate and senior undergraduate
students to conduct research in the area of computer security and
privacy. It covers the main topics in computer security, such as
encryption methods, public key cryptography, hash function and signature
schemes, key exchange protocols, secret sharing, homomorphism,
authentication and access control models, multimedia security and
homeland security. Privacy preserving techniques such as data
aggregation, perturbation, k-anonymity and l-diversity, and ethical
issues are also discussed. Upon completion, the students should be able
to understand the theoretical and practical aspects of security and
privacy, and open up to the current research challenges in this area.
